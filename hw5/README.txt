Question 3 Discussion

The trade-off of this application is we can easy to complete the assignment by using Event Coverage.
Compare to Event Interaction Coverage or Length-n Event-sequence coverage, and they are required to write more test
cases for robust tests. For Event-Interaction coverage, since each of the tests would turn in to N * (N-1) tests.
Hence it required to write the number of tests to achieve. For Length-n event sequence coverage, it also requires many
test cases to be written to give the best result of how the software uses. The advantage of not writing them is saving
time. Both of the coverages require many tests to perform. It is time-consuming, and it is inefficient for an extensive
program. They are suitable for small programs.
